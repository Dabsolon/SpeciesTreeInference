# Inferring Species Trees

This repository contains tutorials for learning about inference of species trees from gene trees that have experienced incomplete lineage sorting. We will use [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) to do inference under the full multispecies coalescent model. We will also use a series of alternative methods that are faster and more scalable to large datasets, but do not use the full MSC model.
