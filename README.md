# Inferring Species Trees

This repository contains tutorials for learning about inference of species trees from gene trees that have experienced incomplete lineage sorting. We will use [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) to do inference under the full multispecies coalescent model. We will also use ASTRAL to perform fast species tree analyses that are scalable to large datasets but also come with some tradeoffs. You will need [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io) and [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL#installation) available on your machine.
